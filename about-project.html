    <h1 id="h1">About This Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This page explains how I planned, designed, and built this website as part of my web development journey. Below, you’ll find a breakdown of the thought process, tools, and help I used to complete it.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Idea</h2>
    <p>The idea to create this website came from my desire to practice building real-world projects. I wanted a simple yet functional site to apply what I’ve learned so far and showcase my growing skills.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Plan</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Start with a basic design and layout using only HTML and CSS.</li>
      <li>Create an "About Me" section, a "Qualifications" section, and a "Skills" section to display relevant information.</li>
      <li>Include a dedicated "Contact" section with my email and public phone number for communication.</li>
      <li>Build an additional page, like this one, to document how the website was created.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">Help</h2>
    <p>I received guidance from ChatGPT to:
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>Plan the structure of the website effectively.</li>
        <li>Learn best practices for writing clean HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>Understand how to create links between pages and use proper styling.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Goal</h2>
    <p>The main goal of this project is to practice web development by building a complete website from scratch. This helps me improve my coding skills, build confidence, and prepare for learning JavaScript and other advanced technologies soon.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Add JavaScript for dynamic interactions (e.g., form validation, animations).</li>
      <li>Improve the design using advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.</li>
      <li>Eventually, host this website online to share my journey with others.</li>
    </ul>
